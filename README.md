Pixel drawing app for The Odin Project

06/28/2023 - Turning off the shadow and highlight mode buttons. Need to step away from this project. 
    -- To implement highlight & shadow -- 
    - read the value of the pixel in hex
    - convert hex to rgba
    - +/- a by 10% 

-- Also  want to change to "click and drag" to draw instead of hover. -- 

--Also need to make it look pretty --
